# vCloud Converter

vCloud Converter turns your vCloud Tools manifests files into [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

[vCloud Tools](https://github.com/gds-operations/vcloud-tools) is now considered feature complete
and so it is recommended to migrate to a newer tool for infrastructure deployment.

vCloud Converter strives to help make this change easier.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'vcloud-converter'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install vcloud-converter

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
